# Z-H97M-D3H-Patches.

All credits go to VioletDragon for his original post. This is a forked repository just to arrange files a little.

Ive done some Patches for both Z97M-D3H & H97M-D3H. I have patched LPC for AppleLPC, USB to keep inside the 15 Port Restrictor in 10.11+. Native Powermanagement, USB 3 works with full speed and current. SSDT-HACK is for Simulating OS X. With all SSDT injectors this machine is fully functional with 10.11+.

Credits to RehabMan for his support on this project.

For Native Powermanagement you will need to generate a SSDT using ssdtPRGen. ssdtPRGen can be downloaded from https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh.
